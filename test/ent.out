Entropy = 4.700432 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1000000 byte file by 41 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1000000 samples is 8846264.11, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 77.4976 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 4.000000000 (error 27.32 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000241 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
